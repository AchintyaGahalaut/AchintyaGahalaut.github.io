            <h1>Average World GDP Per Capita Over Time</h1>
            <p class="content">Average world GDP per capita has increased over time despite significant economic events
                like
                recessions and wars. As the world entered the 21st century with the invention of the world wide web
                during the 1990s,
                we can see how major, global economic events start to have a greater impact on average world GDP,
                whereas
                similar
                events did not change the global GDP per capita significantly before 1990. The web allowed for
                businesses to
                reach a
                global audience, which generally increased economic health indicators like imports, exports, and
                employment rates, leading to higher GDPs per capita. The web also increased global economic
                codependency,
                which
                is why average world GDP per capita starts to react more to economic events post 1990-1991.

            <h1>GDP Per Capita Line Graph Per Country</h1>
            <p class="content">GDP per capita for each country continued to increase from 1960 to 2020. Note that 1990
                marks a significant
                moment in time for each country as, around that time, GDP per capita starts to fluctuate more. This
                gradual increase
                in GDP per capita - along with its more emphasized fluctuation after 1990 -
                can be attributed to the effect of the internet on economic health. Thus, it can be concluded that
                average
                economic comfort has increased for each country as a result of global interconnectedness due to the
                world wide web,
                albeit at the cost of more
                sensitivity for each country to major economic events around the globe. Take for example how
                the early 1980s recession did not cause significant change in any country's GDP per capita. However,
                almost
                every country was negatively
                impacted by the 2008 financial crisis although it started in the United States. This negative impact can
                be seen
                through the relative decrease in the GDP per capita in 2009, the year after the 2008 recession.

            <h1>GDP Per Capita Choropleth Map</h1>
            <p class="content">From 1960 to 2020, on average, countries have gotten richer as their GDP per Capita has
                increased.
                From this, it can be inferred that economic comfort across the world has gradually increased since the
                1960s. Notice that global trends in GDP per capita start to become more apparent after 1990 as GDP per
                Capita for each country sees more fluctuation, primarily in first world countries. Note how
                the 1981-1982 recession did not cause significant change in countries' GDP per capita, while the
                2008-2009
                recession causes world GDP per capita to signficantly decrease (use arrow keys to switch between 1981
                and 1982 or 2008 and 2009 to
                observe the differences).
